# Boston-House-Price-Prediction using Linear Regression Model
In this project, I developed and evaluated the performance and the predictive power of a model trained and tested on Boston House Price dataset collected from Kaggle. I explore the data with pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn, make predictions with scikit-learn and eveluate using Linear Regression Model.
